# Deep Learning Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my Deep Learning Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of deep learning projects in various domains, demonstrating my skills and expertise as a data scientist and machine learning engineer. Each project provides step-by-step instructions, code, and visualizations to showcase the data analysis and modeling techniques employed.

## [Project 1: Celebrity Face Recognition](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/DL_Projects_on_Images/tree/main/Celebrity_Face_Recognition)

In this project, I analyzed and visualized the insights of the chat data. The data is sourced from a group that I was part of. I just downloaded the chat as a text file from WhatsApp.

## [Project 2: Chess position FEN Prediction](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/DL_Projects_on_Images/tree/main/Chess_position_FEN_Prediction)

This project aims to distinguish between a signal process that produces Higgs bosons and a background process that does not.

## [Project 3: Dog Breed Prediction](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/DL_Projects_on_Images/tree/main/Dog_Breed_Classificationh)

This projects aim to detect whether fraud is committed by the merchant or not using machine learning techniques based on the details of the merchant, customer and order placed by the customer.

## [Project 4: Patient Survival Predication](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/DL_Projects_on_Images/tree/main/Patient_Survival_Prediction)
This project calculates “Customer Lifetime Value” with a proprietary formula to drive marketing decisions and customer relationship management.

## [Project 5: Potato Disease Classification](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/DL_Projects_on_Images/tree/main/Potato_Disease_Classification)

This project aim to prevent the overstocking and understocking of goods for retailers based on store information, product information and sales of the products.

## [Project 6: Image Scraping](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/DL_Projects_on_Images/tree/main/google_image_scrapping)

This projects aim to prevent the overstocking and understocking of goods for retailers based on store information, product information and sales of the products.
